# **Walmart Sales Forecasting**

## **Overview**
This project aims to improve Walmart's sales forecasting accuracy using a combination of statistical and machine learning models. By leveraging historical sales data and external factors such as holidays and economic indicators, we provide actionable insights to optimize inventory, staffing, and promotional strategies.

## **Dataset**
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Walmart Sales Forecasting Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/walmart-sales?resource=download)).
- **Size**: 6,435 rows across multiple Walmart stores.
- **Features**:
  - **Weekly_Sales**: Target variable.
  - **Date**: Converted into temporal features (Year, Month, Week).
  - **Economic Indicators**: CPI, Unemployment, Fuel Price.
  - **Holiday_Flag**: Indicates whether the week includes a holiday.

## **Key Features of the Project**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and transformed the data.
   - Engineered lagged features (**Lag_1**, **Lag_2**) and rolling averages (**Rolling_4**) to capture time-series trends.
   - Encoded holiday weeks using a binary **Holiday_Indicator**.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identified seasonality and holiday-driven sales spikes.
   - Correlation analysis between sales and economic factors like CPI and unemployment.
   - Visualized trends using heatmaps, scatter plots, and time-series graphs.

3. **Modeling Approach**:
   - **Linear Regression**: Baseline model to analyze feature relationships.
   - **Decision Tree**: Captures non-linear interactions.
   - **ARIMA**: Time-series model for seasonal trends.
   - **XGBoost**: Advanced machine learning model for feature-rich predictions.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated models using metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE.
   - ARIMA provided the most accurate forecasts, while XGBoost highlighted critical feature importance.

5. **Recommendations**:
   - Use ARIMA for short-term operational planning.
   - Leverage XGBoost for strategic decision-making, particularly during holidays and economic downturns.

## **Results**
- **Best Model**: ARIMA
  - RMSE: 51,245
  - MAPE: 2.02%
- **Other Models**:
  - **XGBoost**: RMSE = 98,151, excellent feature insights.
  - **Decision Tree**: RMSE = 537,942, interpretable but less accurate.
  - **Linear Regression**: RMSE = 557,239, useful as a baseline.
